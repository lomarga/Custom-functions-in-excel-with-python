# Custom-functions-in-excel-with-python




An .xlsm an .py file with different ML models that can be run using functions in excel using the xlwings python library.

Custom functions:

## Linear Regression
pred_lr
coefficients_lr
intercept_lr
score_lr
rsme_lr

## Kmeans
kmeans_cluster
kmeans_centroids





to configurate excel so it can allow custom functions created in python, go to:
https://docs.xlwings.org/en/stable/udfs.html





you can find the video tutorial wich i was based on (for linear regression model):

PD: i added more custom functions for the linear regression model explained in the video (r2, RSME, coefficients and intersect)
